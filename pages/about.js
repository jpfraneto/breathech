        <p>
          I&apos;m JP, engineer by profession that decided to teach himself how
          to code to develop craftmanship in the creative act of writing code. I
          work as a breathwork facilitator by vocation, using this incredible
          tool as the means for helping people to develop creative ways to
          approach the problems that they are facing in their work,
          especifically in the tech industry.
